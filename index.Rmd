# Introduction

## Installation

For reproducibility, `renv` was used to lock packages used.  After cloning the repo, restore from the lock file using `renv::restore()` to hopefully operate under the same environment.


## Contents
- `00-preprocess-TCR.Rmd` describes how to download data from Adaptive, merges the raw files, and parses some of the sample metadata. It creates a file 
- `10-tables.Rmd` tabulates sample summary table S4 and sample pair statistics for tables S6 (human) and S12 (mouse)
- `20-exploratory-trees.Rmd` assesses cross sample and cross individual pairwise comparisons of repertoire overlap
- `21-figure1.Rmd` generates the data summary figures found in Figure 1 and supplementary
- `22-figure2.Rmd` generates the trees, scatterplots, and heatmaps found in Figure 2
- `23-figure3-S4-S5.Rmd` generates all the alluvial plots
- `24-figure4.Rmd` generates all the venn diagrams of clone overlap
- `25-figure5-S7-VECTRA.Rmd` generates the plots of cell types from the imaging data.  The imaging data is not public, but this is included for analysis transparency
- `30-figureS2.Rmd` 
- `32-FigureS12B-S12C-assess-cell-types.Rmd`
- `33-figureS3.Rmd`
- `37-figureS12D-abundance.Rmd`
- `38-figureS4P-tableS5-UC-TCRs.Rmd`
- `39-figure-S3-S8-S11.Rmd`
- `41-figureS12A-addressing-questions-of-sampling-depth.Rmd`
- `index.Rmd` is this document
