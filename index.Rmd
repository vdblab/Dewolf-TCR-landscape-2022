# Introduction

## Installation

For reproducibility, `renv` was used to lock packages used.  After cloning the repo, restore from the lock file using `renv::restore()` to hopefully operate under the same environment.


## Contents
- `00-preprocess-TCR` describes how to download data from Adaptive and merges the raw files
- `01-prepare-GTEx` downloads data from GTEx, generates some summary plots, and saves objects relevant for later figures
- `02-prepare-TCR` generates the objects from the GTEx data and makes TCR tree figures
- `03-figures` generates heatmaps, trees, and the GTEx/TCR comparison figures
